# Countdown-Timer

This is a rendition of a countdown template from uidesigndaily.

It counts down the time to New Years from the current date open opening the app

Date is simply initiated as the current time and compared to the target date (New Years) and state is updated using the Math library to calculate days, hours, minutes 
and seconds

CSS Grid was used to style the app, scaling below 1080 needs to be updated
